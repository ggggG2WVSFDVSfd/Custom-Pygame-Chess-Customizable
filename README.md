This version has check, checkmate, pawn upgrades, castling, en passant, etc.

There is an option to play against an AI player, which is able to plan a few moves in advance. Still not very good.

I also made it so that each piece is an object and it is very easy to add fairy pieces like the knook. The AI should be able to use fairy pieces competently, but you have to enter a piece value
